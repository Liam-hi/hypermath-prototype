Hypermath is a prototype application designed for performing mathematical computations related to abstract algebra. The design and functionality is influenced by the Python IDLE development environment.

## Features
-  solve abstract algebra problem
- provides error messages in the terminal that the "compiler" is unable to read variables or scripts (NameError, VariableError).
- toggle between light mode and dark mode
- mobile ready 

## Available scripts: 
```diff
+ hypermath -version command returns the current version number
```
```diff
+ havelHakimi(list) command checks whether the graph represented by the input list is connected or not. Example: havelHakimi([4, 3, 2, 1]).
``` 
```diff
+ estimateVolume(a, b) command estimates the volume of a hypersphere of dimension a and radius b using Monte Carlo integration. Example: estimateVolume(3,2)
``` 
```diff
+ The polynomialGroup(polynomial, z) command finds the roots for polynomial rings and fields in z. Example: polynomialGroup(x^2 + 4, 10)
```
